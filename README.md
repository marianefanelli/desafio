# Challenge

## Hi my name is Mariane, but you can call me Mari
## In this project you will find a simple demonstration of how to use Cucumber with Cypress to test an application

### You must already have the following technologies installed on your machine:
- Node.js and npm
- Git
- VScode

### Okay, now let's go to the next step:
- Clone this repository on Github
- Run the command "npm install" in your terminal to install the required dependencies

## Run the following script to run the tests

```
$ npm run test
```

## Thank you!
